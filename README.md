# GauntFactory
Free-free and bound-free Gaunt factors and continuum radiation based on Sommerfeld theory.

## Introduction
This code implements the Sommerfeld theory of the free-free and bound-free Gaunt factors. These quantities allow calculating
continuum emission and absorption spectra in hot plasmas given the electron velocity distribution function.
